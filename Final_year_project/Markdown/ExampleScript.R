set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
num_months <- 60  # 5 years of data
diesel_prices <- rnorm(num_months, mean = 3, sd = 0.5)  # Example mean and standard deviation for diesel prices
super_prices <- rnorm(num_months, mean = 4, sd = 0.7)  # Example mean and standard deviation for super prices

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Convert the simulated data into time series objects in R.

# Example code for data preprocessing
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")  # Example start date
goil_ts_diesel <- ts(diesel_prices, start = start_date, frequency = 12)
goil_ts_super <- ts(super_prices, start = start_date, frequency = 12)

# Visualize simulated data
plot(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Simulated Time Series Plot of Diesel Prices", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Price")
plot(goil_ts_super, main = "Simulated Time Series Plot of Super Prices", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Price")

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the simulated data.
# Use autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify any temporal dependencies.
# Investigate the presence of seasonality and trends in the data.

# Example code for EDA
# Summary statistics
summary(goil_ts_diesel)
summary(goil_ts_super)

# Autocorrelation plot
acf(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Autocorrelation Plot of Diesel Prices")
acf(goil_ts_super, main = "Autocorrelation Plot of Super Prices")

# Partial autocorrelation plot
pacf(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Plot of Diesel Prices")
pacf(goil_ts_super, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Plot of Super Prices")

# Step 4: Model Selection
# Based on the characteristics observed in the EDA, select appropriate time series forecasting models.
# Common models include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or machine learning methods like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
# Consider the seasonal nature of fuel prices when choosing the model.

# Step 5: Model Fitting
# Split the simulated data into training and testing sets.
# Fit the selected model(s) to the training data.

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
# Validate the model using the testing dataset.
# Measure the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
# Compare the model's predictions against actual prices to assess accuracy.

# Step 7: Forecasting
# Once the model is validated, use it to forecast future prices of the Goil products.
# Generate confidence intervals around the forecasts to provide a measure of uncertainty.

# Step 8: Interpretation and Reporting
# Interpret the results of the forecasting model(s) in the context of the objectives stated.
# Discuss the implications of the forecasts for minimizing risks associated with oil price volatility, aiding potential investors, and understanding pricing patterns.
# Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, possibly using visualizations to enhance understanding.
# Provide recommendations based on the analysis conducted.
