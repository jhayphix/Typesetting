# **OVERVIEW**

### Step 1: Data Collection 

-   Gather historical pricing data for the Goil products (super and diesel) from Ghana Oil Company Limited.

-   Ensure the dataset contains relevant timestamps for each price entry to establish the time series aspect.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing 

-   Check for missing values and outliers.

-   Convert the data into a time series object in R.

-   Explore the data visually using plots to understand its characteristics (e.g., trend, seasonality, and volatility).

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

-   Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the data.

-   Use autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify any temporal dependencies.

-   Investigate the presence of seasonality and trends in the data.

### Step 4: Model Selection 

-   Based on the characteristics observed in the EDA, select appropriate time series forecasting models. Common models include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or machine learning methods like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

-   Consider the seasonal nature of fuel prices when choosing the model.

### Step 5: Model Fitting

-   Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, a portion of the data is reserved for model validation.

-   Fit the selected model(s) to the training data.

### Step 6: Model Evaluation 

-   Validate the model using the testing dataset.

-   Measure the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

-   Compare the model's predictions against actual prices to assess accuracy.

### Step 7: Forecasting 

-   Once the model is validated, use it to forecast future prices of the Goil products.

-   Generate confidence intervals around the forecasts to provide a measure of uncertainty.

### Step 8: Interpretation and Reporting Interpret the results of the forecasting model(s) in the context of the objectives stated. 

-   Discuss the implications of the forecasts for minimizing risks associated with oil price volatility, aiding potential investors, and understanding pricing patterns.

-   Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, possibly using visualizations to enhance understanding.

-   Provide recommendations based on the analysis conducted.
