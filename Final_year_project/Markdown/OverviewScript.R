# Step 1: Data Collection
# Gather historical pricing data for the Goil products (super and diesel) from Ghana Oil Company Limited.
# Ensure the dataset contains relevant timestamps for each price entry to establish the time series aspect.

# Example code to load data
library(readxl)
goil_data <- read_excel("Goil.xlsx")

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Check for missing values and outliers.
# Convert the data into a time series object in R.
# Explore the data visually using plots to understand its characteristics (e.g., trend, seasonality, and volatility).

# Example code for data preprocessing
# Check for missing values
missing_values <- sum(is.na(goil_data$diesel)) + sum(is.na(goil_data$super))

# Convert data to time series object
goil_ts_diesel <- ts(goil_data$diesel, start = c(YYYY, MM), frequency = 12) # Adjust start date and frequency
goil_ts_super <- ts(goil_data$super, start = c(YYYY, MM), frequency = 12) # Adjust start date and frequency

# Visualize data
plot(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Time Series Plot of Diesel Prices", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Price")
plot(goil_ts_super, main = "Time Series Plot of Super Prices", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Price")

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
# Use autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to identify any temporal dependencies.
# Investigate the presence of seasonality and trends in the data.

# Example code for EDA
# Summary statistics
summary(goil_ts_diesel)
summary(goil_ts_super)

# Autocorrelation plot
acf(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Autocorrelation Plot of Diesel Prices")
acf(goil_ts_super, main = "Autocorrelation Plot of Super Prices")

# Partial autocorrelation plot
pacf(goil_ts_diesel, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Plot of Diesel Prices")
pacf(goil_ts_super, main = "Partial Autocorrelation Plot of Super Prices")

# Step 4: Model Selection
# Based on the characteristics observed in the EDA, select appropriate time series forecasting models.
# Common models include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or machine learning methods like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
# Consider the seasonal nature of fuel prices when choosing the model.

# Step 5: Model Fitting
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Fit the selected model(s) to the training data.

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
# Validate the model using the testing dataset.
# Measure the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
# Compare the model's predictions against actual prices to assess accuracy.

# Step 7: Forecasting
# Once the model is validated, use it to forecast future prices of the Goil products.
# Generate confidence intervals around the forecasts to provide a measure of uncertainty.

# Step 8: Interpretation and Reporting
# Interpret the results of the forecasting model(s) in the context of the objectives stated.
# Discuss the implications of the forecasts for minimizing risks associated with oil price volatility, aiding potential investors, and understanding pricing patterns.
# Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, possibly using visualizations to enhance understanding.
# Provide recommendations based on the analysis conducted.
